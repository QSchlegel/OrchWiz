# Agent VPC Marketing Execution (4 Weeks)

Audience: AI infra engineers  
Primary CTA: Start local in 15 minutes  
North star metric: Active external contributors per month

## Week 1 - Positioning Ship

Deliverables:

- Landing page with Agent VPC narrative and tracked CTAs
- README refresh with 15-minute quickstart + architecture visual
- Contributor docs and issue templates

Post to publish (GitHub Discussion draft):

Title: **What is an Agent VPC?**

Draft:

OrchWiz is our answer to a recurring Agent Ops problem: teams can run agents, but they cannot reliably enforce runtime boundaries, policy controls, and reviewable audit paths across local + cloud systems.

We are positioning OrchWiz as an **Agent VPC**:

- Boundary: private-by-default runtime boundaries across nodes
- Control: policy gates and permission controls
- Traceability: auditable prompts, actions, and security scoring

If you build agent infrastructure, we are looking for contributions in runtime adapters, security checks, and topology operations.

Start local in 15 minutes from the README.

## Week 2 - Discovery Push (Show HN)

Deliverables:

- Show HN post
- Maintainer response loop for technical comments
- README FAQ updates from questions

Show HN draft title:

**Show HN: OrchWiz, an Agent VPC for local + cloud AI operations**

Show HN post body seed:

I built OrchWiz to treat agent operations like networked systems, not scripts: explicit runtime boundaries, policy controls, and traceability across local and cloud nodes.

Current focus:

- policy-controlled execution and forwarding
- auditable traces and security scorecards
- contributor-friendly runtime adapter work

Would value feedback from infra engineers on where boundary/control/traceability is still weak.

## Week 3 - Technical Deep Dive

Deliverables:

- Blog/discussion deep dive: policy-controlled Agent Ops in practice
- Link to concrete integration/runtime-adapter issues

Deep-dive outline:

1. Why generic "agent platform" messaging fails operators
2. Agent VPC model: boundary, control, traceability
3. Concrete controls in OrchWiz (forwarding guardrails, policy checks, encrypted traces)
4. Failure modes and threat posture improvements
5. Contributor map for runtime adapters and governance checks

## Week 4 - Community Momentum Update

Deliverables:

- Progress update post with contributor highlights
- README top-section refresh using strongest proof points from community feedback

Progress update template:

- New contributors this month:
- External PRs opened:
- External PRs merged:
- Top issues closed:
- Most requested next capability:

## Measurement (GitHub-native + UTM)
